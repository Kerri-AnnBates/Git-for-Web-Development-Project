Hello, Kerri-Ann here!
I am super excited to gain more technical skills. I've already learned some new things about HTML and CSS, and I thought I had a good understanding of them before. And now GitHub! Makes me more excited for what's to come. Hope I will finally be able to grasp JS at a deeper level.
